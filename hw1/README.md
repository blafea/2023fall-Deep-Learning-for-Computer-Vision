# Usage
To start working on this assignment, you should clone this repository into your local machine by using the following command.

    git clone https://github.com/DLCV-Fall-2023/hw1-<username>.git
Note that you should replace `<username>` with your own GitHub username.

# Submission Rules

### Packages
This assignment should be done using python3.8. For a list of packages you are allowed to import in this assignment, please refer to the requirments.txt for more details.

You can run the following command to install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Note that using packages with different versions will very likely lead to compatibility issues, so make sure that you install the correct version if one is specified above. E-mail or ask the TAs first if you want to import other packages.

If your model checkpoints are larger than GitHubâ€™s maximum capacity (50 MB), you could download and preprocess (e.g. unzip, tar zxf, etc.) them in `hw1_download_ckpt.sh`.
* TAs will run `bash hw1_download_ckpt.sh` prior to any inference if the download script exists
